For downloading the source code you should have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine.
For testing the app (as described below) you should have python3 installed on your machine. You can get that [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to download?

```
git clone https://github.com/yairabf/Web_Course_Project.git
```

## Building the docker image
Build the docker image by putting the **dockerfile** in the same level with **executor** and **server** folders.
then run the command:
```
sudo docker-compose build calculator
```
You should run this command after every change you make in the **Calculator** source code.

## Making changes
If you want to make changes in the app, make sure -as was mentioned- to rebuild it after making the changes.
Neither the less, after making changes it is highly recommended to run unit tests and integration tests as described below.


# Test the app
For testing the app you should run the following command (from the the app directory):
```
npm run test
```
This command will run unit and integration tests on the app, and  will output if tests were successful or not.
You can add or edit the tests by modifying  **test_calculate_executor.py** and **test_server_integration.py** located in the [tests](https://github.com/eladAlfassi/CalculatorApp/tree/master/tests) directory.
